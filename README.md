Portfolio Project - Udacity FEND Project #2

This is a simple portfolio page that sizes responsively.

The project helps to reinforce learning from an HTML and CSS class as well as a Responsive Images class.  The page shows the projects I've done so far in the Front End Nano Degree program at Udacity and my website.
